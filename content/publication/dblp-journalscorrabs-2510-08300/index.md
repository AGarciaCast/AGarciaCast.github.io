abstract: 'Amortized optimization accelerates the solution of related optimization
  problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure across problem instances.
  We explore the use of Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks (ScaleGMNs) for this
  purpose. By operating directly in weight space, ScaleGMNs enable single-shot fine-tuning
  of existing models, reducing the need for iterative optimization. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of this approach empirically and provide a theoretical result:
  the gauge freedom induced by scaling symmetries is strictly smaller in convolutional
  neural networks than in multi-layer perceptrons. This insight helps explain the
  performance differences observed between architectures in both our work and that
  of Kalogeropoulos et al. (2024). Overall, our findings underscore the potential
  of symmetry-aware metanetworks as a powerful approach for efficient and generalizable
  neural network optimization.'
