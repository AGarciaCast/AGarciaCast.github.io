abstract: ' We propose HyperSteiner – an efficient heuristic algorithm for computing
  Steiner minimal trees in the hyperbolic space. HyperSteiner extends the Euclidean
  Smith-Lee-Liebman algorithm, which is grounded in a divide-and-conquer approach
  involving the Delaunay triangulation. The central idea is rephrasing Steiner tree
  problems with three terminals as a system of equations in the Klein-Beltrami model.
  Motivated by the fact that hyperbolic geometry is well-suited for representing hierarchies,
  we explore applications to hierarchy discovery in data. Results show that HyperSteiner
  infers more realistic hierarchies than the Minimum Spanning Tree and is more scalable
  to large datasets than Neighbor Joining. '
