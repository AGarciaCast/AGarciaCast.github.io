abstract: We study the problem of constructing Steiner Minimal Trees (SMTs) in hyperbolic
  space. Exact SMT computation is NP-hard, and existing hyperbolic heuristics such
  as HyperSteiner are deterministic and often get trapped in locally suboptimal configurations.
  We introduce Randomized HyperSteiner (RHS), a stochastic Delaunay triangulation
  heuristic that incorporates randomness into the expansion process and refines candidate
  trees via Riemannian gradient descent optimization. Experiments on synthetic data
  sets and a real-world single-cell transcriptomic data show that RHS outperforms
  Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), Neighbour Joining, and vanilla HyperSteiner (HS). In
  near-boundary configurations, RHS can achieve a 32% reduction in total length over
  HS, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in diverse data regimes.
